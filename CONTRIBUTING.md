### I'm hesitating to contribute

Don’t worry! 💪  
You don’t need to be an expert. The best way to learn is by doing. Look through beginner-friendly issues and start small. If you're stuck:
- Google it first (you learn a ton this way).
- Ask us on Discord or in the issue thread.

You're not alone — we're all here to grow together.

## Style Guide 🎨

Keep your code clean and consistent:
- Use meaningful names.
- Keep indentation and formatting consistent with the codebase.
- Write clear and concise comments when needed.
- Follow any existing patterns already in the code.
- More about this will be discussed in the session, be sure to join that

If you're unsure about style, check how other parts of the code are written and follow suit.

## Standard Commit Message 📦

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/) standard. Format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, white-space, etc.
- `refactor`: Code restructure (no feature or fix)
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `ci`: CI config changes
- `build`: Build-related changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Example:**
```
feat(ui): add dark-mode
feat(fix): fixed the backend logic
feat: did this
fix: fixed that
```
We wont't be very strict with this but nice to write proper commit messages.
